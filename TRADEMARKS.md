# Trademarks

This document describes how the **Cyber Code Syndicate** name, logos, and other brand assets may be used.

> This policy is about **branding**. It does not replace or modify any open-source license that may apply to code in other repositories.

---

## 1) Ownership

All trademarks, service marks, logos, and brand identifiers associated with Cyber Code Syndicate (collectively, “Marks”) are owned by Cyber Code Syndicate.

Examples include:
- “Cyber Code Syndicate”
- “Cyborg Code Syndicate”
- Organization logos, icons, and visual identity assets
- Product names used across the organization (where applicable)

---

## 2) What is allowed (without permission)

You may use the Marks **only** to make truthful, non-misleading statements such as:
- Referring to the organization or projects by name (e.g., “Works with Cyber Code Syndicate libraries”)
- Linking to official repositories or documentation
- Accurate attribution in articles, talks, videos, or comparisons
- Stating compatibility (e.g., “compatible with X”), provided it is true and not misleading

When in doubt, keep usage **text-only**, minimal, and clearly non-affiliated.

---

## 3) What is not allowed (without written permission)

You may **not**:
- Use the Marks in a way that suggests **endorsement, sponsorship, or official status**
- Use the Marks as part of your **company name, product name, domain name, repository name, or social media handle**
- Use our logos/icons as your primary branding, app icon, or project logo
- Name a fork or derivative project in a way that makes it look official (e.g., “Cyber Code Syndicate Pro”, “Official Cyber Code Syndicate Framework”)
- Sell products or services using the Marks in marketing materials in a way that implies partnership or endorsement

---

## 4) Forks and derivatives: naming rules

Forks are allowed where the underlying code license permits it, but branding must be clear:

- **Do not** use our logos in your fork.
- **Do not** use “Cyber Code Syndicate” (or confusingly similar names) in the fork’s project name.
- You **may** say: “Fork of Cyber Code Syndicate <project>” in descriptive text, as long as it’s clear the fork is **unofficial**.

Recommended wording:
- “Unofficial fork of <project> originally by Cyber Code Syndicate.”

---

## 5) Use in client work

You may reference Cyber Code Syndicate projects in client work and documentation as factual attribution and dependency information. Do not present your work as officially produced, certified, or endorsed by Cyber Code Syndicate unless you have written permission.

---

## 6) Permission requests

If you want to use any Mark in a way not explicitly allowed here (including logos, co-branding, or naming), request permission via the support channel listed in `SUPPORT.md`.

Include:
- Where the Mark will appear (screenshots/links)
- The exact Mark(s) you want to use
- The purpose and distribution scope

---

## 7) Enforcement

We may request changes to or removal of any use of the Marks that violates this policy. Continued misuse may result in additional action, including takedown requests where applicable.

---

## 8) Disclaimer

This policy is provided for clarity and brand protection. It is not legal advice.
