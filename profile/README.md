## What we are
Cyborg Code Syndicate is a collective of skilled software engineers merging human insight with AI to build smarter, faster, more adaptable systems.  
We stay behind the scenes—while our engineering speaks for itself.

### Mission
We architect solutions for humans and AI—building tools and helping others solve their toughest challenges with clarity, speed, and resilience.

### Vision
A future of intelligent, adaptive systems that evolve alongside humans and AI—engineering that keeps pace with the world around it.

## Open-source arsenal
We publish our tooling as public repositories—**open to use by everyone**.  
Write access is limited to Syndicate members, but **external contributions are welcome via pull requests**.

| Project | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Ring of Automation** | One E2E test framework to rule them all — AI-native, multi-platform, plug & play, evolvable | Coming soon |
| **Pandora** | Open the gates for AI engineers — metadata, structure, and artifacts built to be understood by AI | Coming soon |
| **Aristotle** | Your private AI university — knowledge, patterns, and engineering playbooks | Coming soon |

> TODO: Replace each project name above with the correct GitHub repo link once your repo names are finalized.
