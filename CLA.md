- use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute Your Contribution
- publicly perform and publicly display Your Contribution

## 3) Patent license grant (if applicable)

To the extent You own or control patent claims that would be infringed by Your Contribution alone or by its combination with the project, You grant the Syndicate and recipients of Syndicate distributions a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the project.

If You initiate patent litigation alleging that the project or a Contribution infringes a patent, any patent licenses granted under this Agreement to You for that project may terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

---

## 4) Your representations

You represent that:
- You have the legal right to grant the licenses in this Agreement.
- Your Contribution is your original work or you have the right to submit it under these terms.
- Your Contribution does not knowingly include third-party confidential information or trade secrets.

## 5) No trademark rights

This Agreement does **not** grant permission to use Syndicate trademarks, names, or logos. Trademark usage is governed by `TRADEMARKS.md`.

## 6) Contributions are optional; acceptance is discretionary

Submitting a Contribution does not guarantee acceptance. Maintainers/Admins may accept, reject, request changes, revert, or remove Contributions at any time to protect quality, security, or organizational risk.

---

## 7) How this Agreement is accepted

For Syndicate organization members, this Agreement is accepted by:
- submitting a Contribution (commit/pull request) to any Syndicate repository, **or**
- explicitly acknowledging this Agreement when requested by Admins/Maintainers.

Admins may require an explicit acknowledgment for first-time contributors.

## 8) Compatibility with repository licenses

This Agreement is designed to work alongside each repository’s `LICENSE`. Where a repository license grants recipients rights, this Agreement ensures the Syndicate has the necessary inbound rights to provide those outbound rights safely.
