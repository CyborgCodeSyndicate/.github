# Copyright & Ownership

This document clarifies copyright ownership and related rights across the **Cyborg Code Syndicate** GitHub organization (“Syndicate”). It is intended to reduce ambiguity for members, users, and future clients.

> This document is informational and not legal advice. If you need legally binding assurances (e.g., for enterprise procurement), consult qualified legal counsel.

## 1) What is protected

- **Source code** is protected by copyright automatically when created.
- **Documentation and written materials** (READMEs, policies, guides) are also protected by copyright.
- **Names, logos, and brand assets** are protected via trademark law and policy (see `TRADEMARKS.md`).

## 2) Ownership of works

### 2.1 Repository license governs usage
Each repository should include a `LICENSE` file. That license controls how third parties may use the contents of that repository. If a repository has no `LICENSE`, third-party reuse may be restricted by default.

### 2.2 Contributions by organization members
Unless otherwise stated in a specific repository (or a signed agreement exists), contributors generally **retain copyright** in their original contributions.

However, by contributing to Syndicate repositories, contributors grant the Syndicate the rights described in `CLA.md` (a broad license to use, modify, distribute, sublicense, and relicense contributions as needed).

### 2.3 Organization stewardship (Admins)
Because the Syndicate may operate as a community (without a separate legal entity), **Admins (organization owners)** act as the stewards of the organization’s assets and repositories. Admins:
- manage repository settings, access, and releases
- decide what is accepted, reverted, or removed
- may change policies and governance documents to protect the organization

This stewardship does not automatically transfer private ownership of a contributor’s work, but it does define operational control and decision authority for the repositories.

## 3) Trademarks and brand usage

The Syndicate name, logos, icons, and brand identifiers are protected. Open-source licenses (and CC licenses for docs) **do not** grant trademark rights.

See `TRADEMARKS.md` for what is allowed and what is not allowed.

---

## 4) Public vs private repositories

- **Public repositories** are intended for broad adoption (e.g., usage via Maven Central). Their licenses should make usage clear.
- **Private repositories** are internal to Syndicate members and may contain proprietary material. Access and redistribution are restricted by repository settings and any applicable notices.

---

## 5) Practical guidance (for maintainers)

For clean ownership and client confidence:
- Ensure every repository has a clear `LICENSE`.
- Keep `NOTICE` / third-party attribution files where required.
- Use `CLA.md` (or DCO) to reduce future ownership disputes.
- Keep `TRADEMARKS.md` up to date to prevent brand misuse.
