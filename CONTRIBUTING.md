# Contributing to Cyber Code Syndicate

Thanks for contributing.

## Pre-release confidentiality (important)
Until a repository’s first public release, all code, discussions, and design details inside this GitHub organization are considered **pre-release**.
Please do not copy, share, or redistribute any content outside the Cyber Code Syndicate organization.

## Contribution workflow (PR-only)
- Contributions are made via **fork + Pull Request**.
- Do not push directly to protected branches (e.g., `main`).
- Keep PRs small and focused.

## Contribution terms (no contracts, just clarity)
By submitting a PR or patch, you confirm:
1) You have the right to contribute the work (it’s yours or you have permission).
2) You allow Cyber Code Syndicate maintainers to include your contribution in releases and redistribute it as part of the project.
3) You will not include third-party proprietary or employer-confidential code.

## DCO sign-off (recommended)
When committing locally, sign off your commits:
