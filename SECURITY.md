# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you found a security vulnerability:
1. Do NOT open a public issue.
2. Contact the maintainers privately (see SUPPORT.md).
3. Provide reproduction steps, affected versions/commits, and impact.

We’ll acknowledge receipt and work toward a fix.
