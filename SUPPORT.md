# Support

This organization contains public repositories for reference and consumption.  
Write access is restricted to Syndicate members. External contributions are not accepted at this time.

## How to report problems or request help

### Preferred: private support intake
To keep triage efficient and protect sensitive context, we prefer support requests via our private channel:

- **Contact:** https://www.cyborgcode.io/contact

#### Subject line tagging (recommended)
To help routing and triage, prefix your message title with:
- **[ISSUE]** <short summary>
- **[QUESTION]** <short summary>
- **[ACCESS]** <short summary>
- **[SECURITY]** <short summary>

Use this route for:
- bug reports
- installation / usage questions
- compatibility questions
- access requests
- anything involving logs, environment details, or private information

### Public issues (only when enabled)
Some repositories may enable GitHub Issues for tracking accepted work items. If Issues are enabled on a repository, you may open an issue there **only after** initial contact/triage, or when explicitly requested.

## What to include
To help us reproduce quickly, include:
- Repository name + module (if applicable)
- Version(s) used
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Minimal reproduction steps
- Environment (OS, Java version, Maven/Gradle, framework versions)
- Logs/screenshots (**remove secrets**)

## Security or sensitive concerns
Do **not** post publicly.  
Use the private contact route above and review `SECURITY.md` in the relevant repository.

## Response expectations
Support is provided on a best-effort basis. Prioritization and final decisions rest with the project maintainers and administrators.
